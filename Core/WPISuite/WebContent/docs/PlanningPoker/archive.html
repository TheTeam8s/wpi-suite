<center><h1>Archiving a Session</h1></center>
Sessions become ready to archive once all final estimates have been submitted by the creator from within the 
View Session Data tab. <br>
In order to archive a session, if you were the creator, you can go to the overview panel, and highlight the
session from within the Ended Sessions branch on the sessions tree.<br>
On the right side of the panel, you will see a button to Archive Session.
Clicking this button will put the session into the Archived branch where it can no longer be edited by anyone,
and where any user, regardless of if they created the session or not, can view the session details. This panel
will display all the session information, but will not allow you to submit a final estimate anymore.
