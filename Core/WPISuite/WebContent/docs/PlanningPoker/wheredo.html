<p>When the planning poker module is first opened, you are viewing the Overview Panel. 
In order to get back to the overview panel from this panel, 
click on the Current Sessions tab, next to the options tab. From the overview 
panel, you can access the navigation buttons, at the top of the screen, and you can access the tree of 
sessions, below and to the left. To the right of the tree of sessions is the panel that will show you 
detailed information about the session you have selected within the tree, and also allow you to 
open a pending session for voting, end the voting on an open session, or archive a closed session that has
a final estimate value for each of the requirements voted on within the session. <br><br>

There are 5 navigation buttons at the top of the Planning Poker module that are enabled under different conditions.
These buttons are as follows.<br><br>

The Create Session button allows you to create a Planning Poker voting session, and is always enabled.<br> 
When the Create Session button is pressed, a new tab will open where you can create a session.<br><br>
The Edit Session button is only enabled when a valid session has been highlighted within the sessions tree
in the overview panel.<br>
This button allows you to edit pending sessions (sessions within the My Pending Sessions branch in the 
sessions tree on the overview panel), and also edit Open sessions (within the Open Sessions branch) that
have not had any of their requirements voted on yet.<br><br>

The Vote on Session button is enabled whenever an open session is highlighted within the sessions tree in the 
overview panel.<br>
Clicking this button will bring you to the session voting panel, where you can vote on the estimation value
for all requirements within a Planning Poker session.<br><br>

The View Results button is enabled only when a session that has been ended, or archived, is highlighted within the
sessions tree. These sessions will appear under the Ended Sessions branch, but only for the creator, and will
also be enabled for non-creator users for any session that has been archived.<br>
Clicking this button will open up a new tab where all users and their corresponding votes are shown. This page
also shows the mean, and median of all votes entered, and is where the session creator will set the final
estimation values for each requirement.<br><br>

The Help and Options button is always enabled, and will open up a new tab that contains this help guide, the
preferences panel, and the deck viewer panel. You can change the panels shown by selecting the one you wish
to view in the drop-down list at the top right of the help and options panel.<br><br>

To the left of this panel is the help guide navigation tree, which you can use to learn more about
the Planning Poker module. <br>
In order to learn more about the options stated above, 
please click on the corresponding node in the help guide tree.
