<center><h1>What is Planning Poker?</h1></center>
<p>Planning poker is a consensus-based estimation tool used by groups of individuals to determine the 
relative size of a task, or requirement, in an unbiased environment. Members of the group will estimate 
how many work units they think a particular task will take, but will not reveal their estimation until 
everyone has voted. In this way, members of the group are unbiased by the estimation votes that other 
members have made, and the project leader will be able to generalize how much work a task might take.
By remaining anonymous during the voting session, members of a group are not influenced by other members' 
estimation votes, so they are required to make an honest vote which can be discussed after voting has completed. <br> <br>
The planning poker procedure is as follows: <br>
A member, generally the leader, of a group will make a planning poker session. Every member of the group will 
be given a notification that the session has started, and when its end date is, if it has one. At this time, 
each member will go to the session and vote on all of the requirements. Once everyone has voted, or the deadline 
is met, or the session creator ends the session, the session creator will be able to view all votes made by the 
group members. The session creator will then make a final estimate, based on data provided such as who voted 
and what their vote was, as well as the mean, median and mode of all of the votes. This final estimate will 
then be sent to the requirement manager to be saved with a new estimate, and then the project leader can assign 
that requirement to an iteration when the requirement needs to be met.</p>
