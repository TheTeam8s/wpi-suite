<center><h1>Create or Edit a Planning Poker Session</h1></center>
<p>To create a planning poker session, you must first click the Create Session button in the top 
left of the planning poker module. <br>
Clicking this button will open up a new panel for you. Inside of this panel, 
you must give your session a name and a description (you can optionally keep 
the default name which contains the date and time at which the 
Create Session button was pressed), a deck, and you can choose whether 
or not you wish to set and end date.<br>
If you do wish to set an end date, simply click the checkbox, and then click 
the date drop down box to open up a calendar and then choose a time. <br><br>
You can also choose to use no deck, which means the voters will input their own number value,
choose from one of the decks that have been created previously, or make a new deck. 
For help on creating a new deck, please refer to the "Creating a new deck" node on the help guide
tree to the left of this panel. <br><br>
Once you are satisfied with the information you have entered on this page, click the next button at the 
bottom right of the panel. Alternatively, you can click cancel and choose to discard all unsaved changes.
When you click cancel, you will always be prompted by a
pop-up window that confirms whether or not you wish to cancel and lose any unsaved changes.<br><br>
Clicking the next button will bring you to the requirement selection page. Inside of the box on the left are 
all of the requirements that are contained within the backlog in the requirements manager. These are all of
the requirements whose estimates have not yet been voted on, and have not yet been assigned to an iteration.
The box on the right contains all of the requirements that will be voted on in the session you are creating, or
editing.<br>
If you click on the double right arrow (the top-most button), all requirements within the unselected box 
(the left side) will be moved into the selected requirements box (the right side). The single right arrow 
(second button down) will move any requirements that have been clicked on and highlighted from the left box
to the right box (unselected to selected). You can select multiple requirements at a time by holding the control
key and clicking. The third button down will act in the same way as the second, but will move highlighted
requirements in the selected box to the unselected box. The fourth button down will move all requirements
in the selected box to the unselected box.<br>
The last button titled "New Requirement" will open up another pane on the right side of the current view where
the user can create a new requirement. In order to learn about creating new requirements, please click on the
"Creating a new requirement" node in the help guide tree to the left.<br><br>
After you are satisfied with all of your selections, you have three options at the bottom of the page. 
You can either cancel, losing all unsaved changes, start
the session, allowing members to vote, or save the session as pending, meaning you can edit it, but nobody
else can see the session until you start it.<br>
A session is editable when it is in the pending sessions branch in the tree on the overview panel 
(in the Current Sessions tab), and when the session is on the open sessions branch, but only before any member
has voted on any of the requirements. A session is only editable by its creator.<br>
If you select a valid session, and click the Edit Session button at the top of the Planning Poker module,
a new tab will open that will be identical to the session creation panel. All saved information will already
be filled in, and the creator may change any of the information, choose or create a new deck, choose different
requirements, or make addition requirements. The creator will still have the option to save the session as
a pending session, or to start the session, and open it for voting.
