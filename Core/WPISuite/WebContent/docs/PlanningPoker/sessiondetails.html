<center><h1>Viewing Session Details</h1></center>
After a session has been ended by the creator, or once it has reached the end date, the session is moved to the
ended sessions branch within the requirements tree on the overview panel. <br>
Once a session has been ended, and is highlighted, the session creator can view the session results by clicking the View Results
button at the top of the module.<br>
Clicking this button will open a new tab where the session information can be reviewed, and final estimates
can be made. On the left side is a table of the requirements that were voted on in a session, along with the 
vote you made, and the final estimate, if it has been submitted.<br>
By highlighting one of the requirements from within the table on the left, the name and description of the
requirement will be displayed, along with the mean, median, and standard deviation (std. dev.) of all 
the votes that were submitted in that session for that requirement. Below this information is a table
containing the names of all of the users who voted on the highlighted requirement, and what their vote was.<br>
using all of the information provided, you can enter a final estimation value for the requirement highlighted by
entering a number into the box at the top right of the panel and clicking the Submit Final Estimate button.<br><br>

Once a final estimate has been submitted, you can still re-submit a final estimate, but you are prompted
to give a reason as to why you are changing this value.<br><br>

Once all final estimates have been submitted, the session is ready to be archived.<br>
To learn more about archiving a session, please refer to the Archiving a Session node in the help guide tree.
