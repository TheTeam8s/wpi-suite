<center><h1>Creating a New Requirement</h1></center>
When the New Requirement button is clicked, a requirement creation pane will be opened on the right side of
the requirement selection panel. <br>
Inside of the requirement creation pane, you are required to fill in the name of the requirement, and a
description for the requirement. All of the other fields are optional. <br>
You have the option to give the requirement a release number, select a type from the drop down list, 
and set the priority of the requirement.<br><br></p>

<p>By default, the iteration is set to backlog, the status is set to new, and the estimate is 0. Both of these fields
are un-editable, as the voting process will decide the estimation value, and the requirement can only be
assigned to an iteration once it has been estimated. <br>
These un-editable fields are only a reminder, and are not vital to
creating a new requirement for estimation at this point in the process.
