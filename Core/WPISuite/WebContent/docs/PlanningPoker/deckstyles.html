<center><h1>Deck Styles</h1></center>
The default deck options are None, and Default, when selecting a deck for a Planning Poker session. <br>
The default deck allows for multiple card selections, and the no deck option allows for a positive, numerical
input.<br><br>
When making a deck, you have the option to select either single, or multiple selection style.<br>
Single selection means you can only select one card from the deck to be your estimate. Multiple selection
means you can select any number of cards from one of them to the maximum number of cards in the deck. This
selection will change what the voter sees when they open up the voting panel to vote on estimates
for the requirements within a section.<br><br>
If the session uses a deck, to the right of the cards is a box that shows you the sum of your current selections.<br>
If the session does not use a deck, the same box is editable, and you simply type your estimation into the box.
