<center><h1>The Voting Panel</h1></center>
After highlighting an open Planning Poker session, you have the option to vote on the session. <br><br></p>

<p>If you click on the Vote on Session button at the top of the module, a new tab will open up and display the
voting panel.<br><br>

On the left side of the panel is the requirements tree. Inside the requirements tree, there is a branch for 
estimates that have not been voted on yet (Need Estimate), and estimates that have already been voted on (Estimated). To the right of the 
requirements tree is the name and description of the requirement that has been highlighted within the tree,
a list of users that have voted on the highlighted requirement, and the voting area at the bottom of the panel.
<br><br></p>

<p>Once you have voted on a requirement, it is sent from the Need Estimate branch to the Estimated branch inside
of the requirement tree on the left side of the panel. At the same time, your name is added to the list
of users who have voted on that requirement. This box is most useful for session creators in order to see who
has voted, so they can determine whether or not to close a session manually, or remind other members
that they need to vote on that requirement within the session. <br><br> 

Once you enter a vote, you have the option to clear your selection(s), or submit your vote with the buttons
at the bottom of the panel. If you submit a vote, you can still click on a requirement in the Estimated branch,
input a new value, or select new cards, and then click Resubmit Estimation.<br><br>
